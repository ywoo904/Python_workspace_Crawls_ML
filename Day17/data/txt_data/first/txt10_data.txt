vail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier's father on the tv series ) . 
there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces . 
we see this in the murdered archbishop, in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail . 
richard gere does a fairly good job. 
at first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer, with no consideration of the truth . 
but we see another side, as he becomes a seeker of justice, and comes to believe in his client. 
alfre woodard , as the judge, is capable, though somewhat wasted in a standard role. 
laura linney also does journeyman work ; nothing spectacular, but acceptable.
