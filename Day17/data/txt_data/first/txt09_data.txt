the acting and direction is top-notch -- never sappy , always touching . 
a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because " i was afraid it would just be really politically correct , and tick me off . " 
all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased , and enjoy. 
it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears. 
but certain memories should not often be rereleased -- in the last few shots , you have to cry.
