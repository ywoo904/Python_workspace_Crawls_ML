john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . 
he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . 
 " a great experiment " , he calls it . 
brooks' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . 
there's a scene where john has just arrived at his mother's house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the " great experiment " , beatrice asks , " now explain to me again why you don't want to stay at a hotel . " 
she still doesn't get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . 
in the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . 
she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . 
when john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze .
