state of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere . 
had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect . 
what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal : all of the expensive f/x amounts to nothing . 
part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie . 
can kids really admire a hero so goody-two-shoes that he screams " hey ! 
you ran a stop sign ! " 
while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle ? 
i think that today's children will respond better to somebody dashing , someone ultra-cool . 
they ( probably ) receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt . 
in addition to the more complex complaints above , there's also the simple stuff : inspector gadget is boring , formulaic and achingly implausible . 
there's no feeling that the director really cares about his story : more than any other film i've seen this year , this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line . 
there's a popular commercial ( for sprite , but that's irrelevant ) running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects . 
it consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious ( thank god ) movie called " death slug ".
