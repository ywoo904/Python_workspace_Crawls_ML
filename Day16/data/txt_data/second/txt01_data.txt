the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . 
it's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope. 
and with speeches like , " i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , " how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ? 
to godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . 
the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful. 
watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . 
and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . 
the environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them .

sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . 
the second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image. 
you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners.
